/*
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

// using one-pass, 这个解法没太看懂
// This solution picks each element from the input array only once. First, we give a candy to the first child. Then for each child we have three cases:
//
// His/her rating is equal to the previous one -> give 1 candy.
// His/her rating is greater than the previous one -> give him (previous + 1) candies.
// His/her rating is less than the previous one -> don't know what to do yet, let's just count the number of such consequent cases.
// When we enter 1 or 2 condition we can check our count from 3. If it's not zero then we know that we were descending before and we have everything to update our total candies amount:
// number of children in descending sequence of raitings - coundDown, number of candies given at peak - prev (we don't update prev when descending).
// Total number of candies for "descending" children can be found through arithmetic progression formula (1+2+...+countDown).
// Plus we need to update our peak child if his number of candies is less then or equal to countDown.
public class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        if (ratings == null || ratings.length == 0) return 0;

            if (ratings[i] >= ratings[i-1]) {
                if (countDown > 0) {
                    total += countDown*(countDown+1)/2; // arithmetic progression
                    if (countDown >= prev) total += countDown - prev + 1;
                    countDown = 0;
                    prev = 1;
                }
                prev = ratings[i] == ratings[i-1] ? 1 : prev+1;
