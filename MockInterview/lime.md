# You are given two parallel lines Y = 0 and Y = Width in a 2-D coordinate system where X axis is the horizontal axis and Y axis is the vertical axis

The input will be the Width and a list of circles with center coordinates (x,y) and radius r.
Your function should return a Boolean which indicate if there exist a path between the two parallel lines that goes from x = -infinity to x = infinity without touching any of the circles.

# Test cases
Width are all 50 for the following test cases
# (10,10, 30), (25,25, 20) T
# (10,10, 30), (25,25, 20), (35,45, 10) F
# (10,10, 30), (25,25, 20), (70,10, 15), (70,20, 15), (80,35, 20) F
# (10,10, 30), (25,25, 20), (70,20, 15), (80,35, 20) T
